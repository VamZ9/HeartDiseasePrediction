# HeartDiseasePrediction
In this Project, I have created a Logistic Regression Model on a small, clean dataset from UCI ML Repository.

This is a simple Logistic Regression model that tries to predict if a person is suffering from a potential Heart Disease or not by analyzing several features like age, sex, cholestrol level, exercise induced agina, rest ECG , etc.
